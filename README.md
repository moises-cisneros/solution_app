# Early Warning System using Deep Learning: Detection of Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes, transmitters of dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever.

## Project Description
The application is a tool that provides information and advice to prevent the spread of dengue fever. It also has an information section where users can learn about dengue and how to prevent it. Additionally, a news section is included, which will be updated on dengue in the area where they live to keep users informed.

The application also includes a map function that visualizes mosquito traps that use deep learning to detect the presence of Aedes aegypti or Culex mosquitoes and count their number. This allows users to know how many mosquitoes are in their area and take preventive measures.

With this application, we hope to help people prevent the spread of dengue and contribute to the eradication of this disease.

## Prerequisites
Before you can run this project on your computer, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

>- Installed Flutter version **3.7.8** or higher.
>- Installed Dart version **2.19.5** or higher.
>- A stable internet connection to download the project's dependencies.
>- A code editor installed, such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.

If you don't have Flutter and Dart installed on your computer, you can download them from the official Flutter website at https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install and follow the installation instructions.

Also, if you don't have a code editor installed, you can download Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download or Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio.

## Instrucciones de instalaciÃ³n
Follow these steps to install and set up this project on your computer:

>- Clone this repository on your computer using Git or by downloading the ZIP file from GitHub.
>- Open your preferred code editor and open the project folder.
>- Open a terminal within the code editor or in your operating system.
>- Run the command **flutter pub get** to download all project dependencies.
>- Run the command **flutter run** to compile and run the application on your device or emulator.

If you encounter any problems while following these steps, please consult the official Flutter documentation at https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install or the Common Problems (FAQ) section in this README.md file.

**Note 1:** If you don't have a mobile device available, you can use an Android or iOS emulator to run the application on your computer. In that case, make sure the emulator is running before running the **flutter run** command. You can use Android Studio or Xcode to set up and run an emulator on your computer.

**Note 2:** If you have tested the application on your own mobile device and it works correctly, this is a good sign that the application is functioning properly. However, please note that results may vary if you use an emulator to run the application. If you decide to test the application on an emulator, you may encounter issues with the location or display of the map, as these aspects may be affected by the emulator's configuration. Therefore, we recommend testing the application on a mobile device whenever possible for the best results.

## Environment Setup
Before working on this project, it's necessary to set up your environment to work with Flutter and Dart. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

>- Download and install Flutter from the official Flutter website at https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
>- Add the Flutter bin directory to your system's PATH. For example, if you installed Flutter in C:\src\flutter, add C:\src\flutter\bin to your PATH.
>- Download and install the Dart SDK from the official Dart website at https://dart.dev/get-dart
>- Add the Dart bin directory to your system's PATH. For example, if you installed Dart in C:\dart-sdk, add C:\dart-sdk\bin to your PATH.

Once you have set up your environment, you can follow the installation instructions in the corresponding section.

## Troubleshooting
Below are some common issues that users might encounter when using this application and how to solve them:

`Issue: The application unexpectedly closes when opening a specific screen.`  
If you experience this issue, there might be an error in the code of that particular screen. To solve it, check the corresponding file and make sure there are no syntax or logic errors. You can also try restarting the application and see if the issue persists.

`Issue: The application doesn't display the Google Maps map correctly.`  
If you're using an emulator to run the application, keep in mind that you might encounter issues related to location permissions and map display. If possible, we recommend trying the application on a real mobile device for best results. Additionally, some users have reported similar issues when running the application on a web browser, such as Edge, while it works correctly on a real mobile device. If you encounter issues with location or map display in the application, try running it on a mobile device or another web browser such as Chrome or Firefox.

`Issue: The application runs slowly or freezes.`  
If the application runs slowly or freezes, it might be due to a resource overload on the device. Try closing other background applications and freeing up memory. You can also try uninstalling and reinstalling the application to resolve any data corruption issues.

`Issue: The application displays a blank screen when opened.`  
If the application displays a blank screen when opened, there might have been a compilation error. Try cleaning the project and compiling it again. You can also try restarting the application and see if the issue persists. If none of these steps solve the issue, try seeking help in the Flutter documentation or the developer community for the platform.
